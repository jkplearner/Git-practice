        import React from 'react'
        export var/let/const  identifier-name = React.createContext()
    step 2 :
        use providers to pass an value
        <identifier-name.provider value={}>
            <child component/>
        <identifier-name.provider/>
    step 3:
    use consumer to consume the value given by provider
        <identifier-name.consumer >
            {
                call back funcntion
            }
