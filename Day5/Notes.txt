Loops :
1. For loop
        The for loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.
        syntax:
            for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        Example for for loop:
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                console.log(i);
            }
    2. While loop
        The while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly while a specified condition is true.
        syntax:
            while (condition) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        Example for while loop:
            let i = 0;
                while (i < 5) {
                    console.log(i);
                    i++;
                }
    3. Do-while loop
        The do-while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly while a specified condition is true
        syntax:
            do {
                // code to be executed
            } while (condition);
        Example for do-while loop:
            let i = 0;
            do {
                console.log(i);
                i++;
            } while (i < 5);
    4. For-each loop:
    The for-each loop is used to iterate over an array or an object.
        syntax:
            for (let variable of iterable) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        Example for for-each loop:
            let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
            for (let fruit of fruits) {
                console.log(fruit);
            }
Block Scope:
    Block scope is a feature of JavaScript that allows variables to be declared within a block of code, such as a for loop or an if statement. This means that the variable is only accessible within that block of code and not outside of it.
Functions in JS:
    Function are first citizens in JS.
    Functions are object in JS.
    Types of Functions in JS:
        1. Function Declaration statement/Pure/named Function
        2. Function Expression
        3. Higher order Function, Call back Function
        4. Arrow Function
        5. nested Function
        6. IIFE (immediate invoking function Expression)
    1. Function declaration statement:
        A function declaration statement is a function that is declared with the function keyword.
        syntax:
            function functionName(parameters) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        Example for function declaration statement:
            function greet(name) {
                console.log("Hello, " + name);
            }
    2. Function Expression:
        A function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable.
        syntax:
            let functionName = function(parameters) {
            // code to be executed
            };
        Example for function expression:
            let greet = function(name) {
                console.log("Hello, " + name);
            };
