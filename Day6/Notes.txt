Functions in JS:
    Function are first citizens in JS.
    Functions are object in JS.
    Types of Functions in JS:
        1. Function Declaration statement/Pure/named Function
        2. Function Expression
        3. Higher order Function, Call back Function
        4. Arrow Function
        5. nested Function
        6. IIFE (immediate invoking function Expression)
    1. Function declaration statement:
        A function declaration statement is a function that is declared with the function keyword.
        syntax:
            function functionName(parameters) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        Example for function declaration statement:
            function greet(name) {
                console.log("Hello, " + name);
            }
    2. Function Expression:
        A function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable.
        syntax:
            let functionName = function(parameters) {
            // code to be executed
            };
        Example for function expression:
            let greet = function(name) {
                console.log("Hello, " + name);
            };
    hoisting means calling the function before function declaration
    Example:
        console.log(greet("John"));
        function greet(name) {
            return "hello!"+name;
        }

    The main advantage of using functions in JS is code resuability
    Task:
        create a function it should perform arthemetic operation for two numbers
Closure and lexical scope
Function Expression:
A function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable.
It is used to perform specific tasks
